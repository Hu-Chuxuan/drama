  "summary": "This report examines the changes in homelessness in the U.S. between 2022 and 2024, with a particular focus on state-level dynamics, contributing factors, and policy impacts. Despite efforts to address homelessness, the overall homeless population saw a significant rise, influenced by economic disparities, end of pandemic-era relief, and other socioeconomic factors. The report highlights specific state trends, particularly in California and New York, and suggests a need for enhanced policy measures to combat rising homelessness.",

      "title": "Percentage Change in the Homeless Population (2022-2024)",
      "content": "From 2022 to 2023, there was a significant 12% increase in the total homeless population in the United States, reaching 653,104 individuals². The rise is attributed to multiple factors, including the end of COVID-19 relief measures and increasing housing costs². The trend persisted into 2024, coupled with new challenges."

      "title": "Factors Affecting Homelessness Trends",
      "content": "The increase in homelessness has been driven by:\n\n- **Economic Inequality**: Disparities in income and housing affordability have widened².\n- **End of COVID-era Assistance**: The conclusion of pandemic relief programs significantly impacted housing stability².\n- **Rising Housing Costs**: Housing and rental costs continue to soar beyond the reach of many low-income households¹.\n- **Immigration**: Influx of new migrants has strained urban housing capacities²."

      "title": "State-Level Dynamics",
      "content": "Homelessness saw varied changes across states:\n\n- **California and New York** saw some of the largest increases, together containing a significant portion of the homeless population².\n- States like **New Hampshire and New Mexico** experienced dramatic percentage increases in homelessness².\n- Only a few states, like **Louisiana and Delaware**, managed to reduce their homeless numbers significantly²."

      "title": "Policy Impacts and Recommendations",
      "content": "Current policies have made some impact, such as increased creation of temporary and permanent housing solutions. However, many states still face challenges:\n\n- Increased funding for affordable housing is critical.\n- Enhancements in supportive services for mental health and substance abuse are necessary².\n- Expansion of eviction prevention programs is needed to manage new cases of homelessness²."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "content": "While policies have been put in place to combat rising homelessness, the overall impact remains limited. States and federal initiatives need to address root causes such as housing affordability and mental health services to see substantial reductions in homelessness²."

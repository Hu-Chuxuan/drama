      "content": "Several factors contributed to the rise in homelessness during this period:  \n\n- **Housing crisis**: Access to affordable housing remained a significant challenge, with high costs contributing to the inability of many individuals to secure stable housing [²].  \n- **Economic pressures**: Rising inflation and stagnating wages were significant pressures that continued to burden those on low incomes [³].  \n- **Policy impacts**: The expiration of COVID-19 relief measures resulted in many losing support without adequate replacement services being put in place [¹][³]."

      "title": "Policy Impacts",
      "content": "The expiration of certain pandemic-related relief policies, such as the eviction moratorium and economic assistance programs, exacerbated the strain on the homeless support systems. Without sustained financial support, the homeless population continued to grow as more individuals and families could not afford housing due to economic vulnerabilities [²]."

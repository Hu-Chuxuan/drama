      "title": "Overview of Homelessness in 2024",
      "content": "In 2024, the United States saw a significant rise in homelessness, with a total of **771,480** people experiencing homelessness, marking the highest number ever recorded[^1^]. Nearly all categories of homeless populations, including families with children, individuals, and unaccompanied youth, have reached record levels. The primary contributing factors include the affordable housing crisis, rising inflation, and the expiry of pandemic-related assistance[^1^]."

    {
      "title": "State-Level Analysis",
      "content": "California holds the highest rate of homelessness, with 48 out of every 10,000 people experiencing homelessness[^1^]. This exceeds the national average of 23 per 10,000 people. Contributing factors include high cost of living, housing shortages, and large populations in urban centers. Furthermore, the capability of support systems to address homelessness is strained by the influx of individuals moving to the state seeking better opportunities[^1^]."

    {
      "title": "Comparison to Previous Years",
      "content": "The data indicates a steady increase in homelessness rates compared to previous years, with **a 34.6% increase** since 2007[^1^]. Factors such as worsening economic conditions and natural disasters have compounded the challenges faced by those on the verge of homelessness. States like Oregon and Washington also show increasing trends, although they do not surpass California's rate[^1^][^3^]."
    },
    {
      "title": "Key Contributing Factors",
      "content": "Several elements contribute to the high rates of homelessness in California: \n- **Affordable Housing Shortage**: California has a significant shortfall in affordable housing units, driving many to homelessness.\n- **Economic Disparities**: Rising income inequality and stagnant wages have made it difficult for lower-income households to afford rising rents.\n- **Urbanization**: Growing urban populations lead to concentrated areas with high demand and low supply of housing."

      "title": "Emerging Trends in 2024",
      "content": "In 2024, the demand for homelessness services increased, overwhelming existing resources. The end of COVID-19 relief measures has led to a growth in unsheltered homelessness, particularly in states with warmer climates. The population of unsheltered individuals grew by significant margins in urban areas[^1^][^3^]."
